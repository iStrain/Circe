# Circe
JavaFX program to help students practice CRC calculations
+ Circe.java (main JavaFX file - includes main() and start() methods);
+ Tone.java (simple ADSR tone generator - just makes keys beep);
+ Circe.css (JavaFX CSS file - includes most of the Styles for GUI components); and
+ Circe.png (background picture for input section).

They should compile OK in Eclipse with Circe.java, Tone.java and Circe.css in the usual /src directory, and Circe.png in a /bin/images directory under the same Project folder.
