# Circe
JavaFX program to help students practice CRC calculations
+ Circe.java (main JavaFX file - includes main() and start() methods, sets up the GUI, ready for the maths code);
+ Tone.java (simple ADSHR tone generator - just makes keys beep, bit of a "work-in-progress"); and
+ Circe.css (JavaFX CSS file - includes most of the Styles for GUI components, we'll edit this to mimic the Applet).

They should compile OK in Eclipse with Circe.java, Tone.java and Circe.css in the usual /src directory.

Current status: if you compile and run it, you can see we have the main window and 3 tabbed panes: 2 labels, 2 text fields, 2 buttons and a logo on the input pane; and a text area on each of the other 2 panes.

We now have the maths part, so it's "full steam ahead" on the program.  Take a look at the new files Ian gave us, and see if you can work out how best to integrate them into the existing framework.  We'll compare notes in "a coupla days", and agree on a way forward!

Cheers,
