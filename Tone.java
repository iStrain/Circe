 * Class Tone: Simple sound generator for Circe Project.  It is simple ... Java does all the work.
 * The methods are threaded so you can go: "new Thread(new Tone(int hz, int msecs)).start()" to play a tone.
 * If you wish, you can also set the volume: "new Thread(new Tone(int hz, int msecs, double vol)).start()", 
 * where "vol" is between 0.0d and 1.0d.
 * To find frequencies that correspond to musical notes, look here: https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html
 * This Class was adapted from some horrible (mainly non-functional) code at Stack Overflow.
 * Coding credits(!): "https://stackoverflow.com/a/6700039"
 * The original worked at the specific combination of sample rate and frequency it used 
 * (for a unique definition of "worked" -- ie. played a completely different frequency).
 * However, it produced silence at the frequencies normal ears can handle.
 * It also blocked the calling method until the sound was finished playing.
 * Finally, it flicked method-specific errors up-the-chain (don't you hate that?).
 * Our adaptation seems to work for frequencies up to about 11KHz, doesn't block, and handles its own errors.  Cough.
